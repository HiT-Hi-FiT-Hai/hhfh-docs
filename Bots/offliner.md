# Overview
All commands need to be prefixed with one of these characters: `+` (plus), `-` (subtract), `*` (caret),
`/` (forward-slash), `!` (exclamation mark), `#` (hash), `?` (question mark). These commands are sent
as a private message to **`[BOT]Offliner`**. If you think that this documentation is missing something
or it can repharased/tweaked in a more user-friendly manner, feel free to send in a pull request. Note
that we have used `/` (forward-slash), you can use any of the above mentioned prefixes. Also note that
LinuxDC++ and a few other clients do not support `/` (forward-slash) as a prefix, use any of the other
mentioned prefixes.
